# Demonstration of Git

This Repository is used as a Demo repository that I will be accessing from VS Code for learning all about Git.

## What is Git?
Git is a free open source distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
By version control we mean the ability to track changes in the source code of a program, and to merge those changes with changes from other sources, and to create a new version of the program. This is a method programmers use to keep track of their work/changes.
